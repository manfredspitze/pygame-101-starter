In Pygame, an **event** is something that happens during the game.

Events are typically triggered by the system or by something the user does while the game is running.

Common events include:

- pressing a key
- moving the mouse
- closing the game window

The Pygame module allows you to listen for and handle these events in your game code.

### Two examples of events in Pygame:

1. **`pygame.QUIT` Event:**
   - This event happens when the user closes the game window (clicks the "X" button on the window).
   - Example: When the player clicks the close button of the window, the game will receive a `QUIT` event, and your code can handle it by stopping the game.

   ```python
   for event in pygame.event.get():
       if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
           # Handle the event to quit the game
           pygame.quit()
           exit()
   ```

2. **`pygame.KEYDOWN` Event:**
   - This event occurs when the player presses a key on the keyboard.
   - Example: If the player presses the "Escape" key, you can use this event to stop the game or perform some other action.

   ```python
   for event in pygame.event.get():
       if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
           if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
               # Handle the event to quit or perform an action
               running = False
   ```

---

In both examples, we listen for events using a loop (`pygame.event.get()`), check the event type, and then define what should happen when that event occurs. 

Events like `QUIT` or `KEYDOWN` are just two examples of the many types of events Pygame can detect and handle.
